# Stress-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This project implements a wrist-based stress detection system using machine-learning methods.  
It was developed as a *Graduation Project at King Saud University – College of Applied Computer Sciences, under the supervision of **Dr. Munahy*.

The system analyzes physiological signals from the *WESAD* dataset and uses a *CatBoost classifier* to determine whether a user is stressed or not based on sliding windows of sensor data.  
The full pipeline includes *feature extraction, a **FastAPI backend, and a **React frontend* for real-time interaction.

##  Overview

The stress-detection model uses wrist-based physiological signals:

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| *BVP* | Blood Volume Pulse (used to estimate heart rate and HRV) |
| *EDA* | Electrodermal Activity (strong stress indicator) |
| *TEMP* | Skin Temperature |
| *ACC_x, ACC_y, ACC_z* | Accelerometer movement data |

### 🪟 Sliding Window Approach  
- Each prediction uses a *6-second window*  
- *50% overlap* for smoother transitions  
- Features extracted per window include:  
  - Statistical features (mean, std, min/max, skewness, kurtosis)  
  - Frequency-domain features  
  - EDA-specific peaks  
  - HRV metrics derived from BVP  
  - Movement energy from accelerometer  

###  Machine-Learning Model  
- Trained using *CatBoost*, achieving high accuracy  
- Trained on labeled segments (stress vs non-stress) from WESAD  
- Exported as .cbm model for deployment

##  Backend (FastAPI)

The backend provides real-time stress prediction.

*Responsibilities include:*
- Loading the trained CatBoost model  
- Receiving 6 raw values from the frontend:
  - BVP, EDA, TEMP, ACC_x, ACC_y, ACC_z  
- Reconstructing a *synthetic 6-second window*  
- Extracting features using the same pipeline as training  
- Returning:
  - Stress status (STRESSED / NOT STRESSED)  
  - Stress probability  
  - Generated advice (based on physiological indicators)

##  Frontend (React)

The React frontend provides:
- A simple interface where users/employees enter vital readings  
- Real-time stress detection results  
- Display of advice generated by the AI model  
- Smooth interaction with the FastAPI backend

##  Technologies Used

- *CatBoost* → machine-learning classification  
- *Python + FastAPI* → backend and model serving  
- *React* → frontend UI  
- *WESAD Dataset* → training and evaluation
